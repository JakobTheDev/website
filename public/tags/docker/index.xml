      <description>Something that I have struggled with in the past as a software developer turned penetration tester is the fact that I use two operating systems on a daily basis, and this sometimes causes friction in my workflow.
Note: I really don’t intend or want this to be a discussion of the merits of one OS or IDE compared with another. I use the tools that I am familiar and productive with, and it’s totally cool if you use something different.</description>

      <description>There were many things to consider, and we may talk about some of those things in the future, but the aspect of penetration testing I want to talk about today is the infrastructure we use to conduct a penetration test.
Note: With a few minor exceptions, the same thought process applies for bug bounty hunting. If that’s more your thing, feel free to sed s/penetration testing/bug bounty hunting/g.
What do we need from our infrastructure?</description>
