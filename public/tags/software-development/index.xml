      <description>This post is Part 3 in a ðŸ¤·-Part series on CI/CD in AWS. Go check out my other posts to see how we got here:
Part 1: Deploy a Single-Page Application (SPA) to AWS
Part 2: Automated Build / Deploy with AWS CodePipeline
In the last post, we set up a simple CI/CD pipeline that deploys our codebase into production each time new code is merged into the production codebase. This is great, but once we kick off a build we have two options:</description>

      <description>In my last post, I showed how you can deploy a Single Page Application to AWS using AWSâ€™ S3, CloudFront and Route 53. This post picks up where the last one left off, so if you havenâ€™t read it, go check it out!
This time, weâ€™ll be improving our DevOps by building a basic CI/CD pipeline. Since weâ€™re already using AWS to host our site, it makes sense to keep using their services since they do integrate well together (Thatâ€™s how they get you!</description>

      <description>Recently, I made a simple personal website â€” a hub for my online presences and a place to share my personal projects. I developed the site using the Angular CLI, and when it came time to host the site, I chose AWS since my domain was already set up in Route 53. Overall, the process of building the application and hosting it on AWS was a fairly simple one (you could probably set the whole thing up in about an hour), but there were a couple of gotchyas that prompted me to write down the process.</description>
