> G'day, I'm Jakob Pennington, and I help development teams build secure software.

I have an obsession for learning, and I aspire to share what I learn with others. Professionally, I share my time between software development, cybersecurity, and where the two disciplines intersect: application security.

## Background

My career has led to application security for two key reasons:
1. Early in my career, as I was cutting teeth as a penetration tester, I realised that a pentest is far too late in the software lifecycle to start thinking about security. I wanted to help developers avoid introducing vulnerabilities in the first place, and to do that, I needed to get involved earlier in the SDLC.
2. I am also a software developer, and enjoy coding far too much to give it up and focus purely on security. 

My experience in both building and hacking software gives me a unique perspective, allowing me to not only find and fix security vulnerabilities, but to also integrate secure development practices to avoid similar vulnerabilities in future.

## Work

I am a Principal Application Security Consultant at [Taptu](https://www.taptu.com.au). My work (and by extension, much of the content in this blog) focusses on:
* **Penetration testing** specialising in web, mobile, desktop and API security.
* **Providing application security expertise** to software development teams.
* **Implementing secure development practices** throughout the SDLC.
* Designing and implementing **secure cloud architectures**.
* Managing **software release processes**, incorporating security testing and secure configuration goodness.
* **Software development**, primarily in TypeScript, C# and Python.
* Authoring and delivering **secure development training and education**.

## On the side

Professionally, but outside of my role at Taptu, I am also:
* Author and Course Coordinator for the Secure Software Development course at the [University of South Australia](https://twitter.com/universitysa).
* Co-organiser of the [SecTalks Adelaide](https://twitter.com/sectalks_ADL) meetup.
* Co-organiser of the [HeapsGoodDev](https://twitter.com/heapsgooddev) meetup.

## Other interests

My love of learning spans well beyond application security. I may write about my other hobbies and interests from time to time, including:
* Running, cycling, health and well-being.
* Productivity and self-improvement.
* Video games, books and other media.
* Woodworking and DIY.
* Cooking.
